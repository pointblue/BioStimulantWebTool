QuestionCode,Option,RecommendationDisplay,
A,Public Land,"You chose a publicly managed landscape. These landscapes are the most conservatively managed. The options for these landscapes are X,Y,Z.",
A,Private Land,"You chose a privately managed landscape. These landscapes can be more innovative, so the options for these are X, Y, Z, A, B.",
B,Prescribed Fire,"You chose a burn scar from a prescribed burn. These prescribed burns, if they remain under control from start to finish, they're low intensity and small and they don't impact the spore bank much, if at all. ",
B,Wildfire,"It looks like your burn scar is from a wildfire. Wildfire can be low intensity and limited in range, but they are more often large and high intensity fires. We tested several treatments, X,Y,Z,A,B in five burn scars across Oregon and California. ",
C,Structure,"Oh, no! Your burn scar included structures. We recommend you test for additional pollutants from electronics, home goods, and furniture. In our tests, structure fires had L,M,N contaminants and treatments X,Y,Z were overall better at removing them than the other tests studied.",
C,No Structure,"Phew, no structures burned! When manmade structures burn, there is additional concern about pollutants from electronics, household goods, and furniture to account for.",
D,Wooded Area,"Since the burn took place in or near a wooded area, it's likely to have been greater intensity.",
D,Other Ecosystem,"Since the burn did not happen in or near a wooded area, it's likely to have been a cooler burning fire that didn't disturb the native fungal spore bank. This ecosystem will recover on its own soon.",
E,Northern,"You're in the North, we have three test burn scars in your region. Burns in these areas tend to increase total nitrogen, organic matter, total carbon and the carbon accessible to microbes. These different starting nutrients impact different biological treatments",
E,Southern,"You're in the South, we have two test burn scars in your region. Burns in these areas tend to decrease the total nitrogen, nitrate, organic material, and carbon (both active and CO2-carbon) and this impacts the sucess of a biological treatment",
